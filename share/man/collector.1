.SH NAME
collector \- a simple script to collect information about your environment.

.SH SYNOPSIS
collector [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Collector is a script that does exactly as its name implies; it collects things. Collector is used to retrieve important files and find important info inside a user\'s home directory, create a sharable archive file, and then educate the user how they can share it with a specific tech. For collector, it does not matter whether the above files exist or not; collector simply looks for them. Once they are found, collector adds them to an archive. Collector also runs a few shell commands on the user's home directory and saves that output to the archive as well. Once collector is done, it creates an archive name $USER_info.

Here is the list of files that collector searches for:
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step]. 10
bashrc \- a shell script run everytime a user creates a new bash shell.

.IP \n+[step].
bash_history \- a helpful log containing previously run bash commands.

.IP \n+[step].
bash_profile \- a shell script executed when a user logs in with their bash credentials.

.IP \n+[step].
bash_logout \- a shell script run everytime a user exits a bash shell session.

.IP \n+[step].
